## Introduction

Welcome to the Todo Application, a simple yet powerful tool to help you manage your tasks efficiently. This application allows you to add, update, delete, and view your todos with ease. Featuring color-based filtering for priority levels (high, medium, low), and status-based filtering (all, incomplete, completed), this app provides a comprehensive solution for task management. You can also mark all todos as completed with a single click and delete all completed tasks effortlessly. The application uses browser local storage as its database, ensuring your data is preserved across sessions.
